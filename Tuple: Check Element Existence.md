# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
~~~
x = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'n', 1, 2, 8, 9)


print("'n' exists in tuple:", 'n' in x)

print("8 exists in tuple:", 8 in x)

~~~
## Output
'n' exists in tuple: True

8 exists in tuple: True

## Result
The program successfully checks for the existence of both 'n' (a string) and 8 (an integer) in the tuple using the in operator. Both elements are found in the tuple, so the result is True for both checks.
